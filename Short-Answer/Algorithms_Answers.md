Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n) - The amount of times the while loop would dependent on n (which is linear) and O(n) is the dominate term.

b) O(n^4) - The algorithm has 3 nested for loops inside of a for loop. Each for loop has a time complexity of O(n) and since each of them are dependent on the one that comes before, the time the algorithm runs is n * n * n * n.

c) O(n) - The amount of times the algorithm needs to run is dependent on the amount of recursive calls which is n.
